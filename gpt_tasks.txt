I want to create auto-uml extension for vs code on typescript.
Idea is as follows: user should be able to create uml as always, automatically generate uml from files in directory and generate code from uml.
It should have:
1) custom file extension .autouml
2) commands:
2.1) to create autouml file from scratch
2.2) to create autouml file from files;
2.3) to update uml for current folder;
2.4) to generate code from uml;
3) custom editor (to display and edit uml);
4) viewcontainer on main sidebar with following views:
4.1) regular file explorer;
4.2) explorer of currently indexed files;
5) context-menu with commands:
5.1) to add class/ function to index;
5.2) to update class according to uml;
5.3) to add class dependencies to uml.
